    <description brief="Model Predictive Control for whole-arm tactile sensing">
        The hrl_haptic_manipulation stack collects the code developed by the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech for performing Model Predictive Control with whole-arm tactile sensing.  The controller attempts to move the end-effector toward a given goal subject to constraints on the force of contact, as reported by the tactile sensor.  Currently supports simulation and real robots, as well as multiple tactile sensors.
