The two folders in this directory reference two research projects I worked on at the Healthcare Robotics Laboratory.  The first, sttr, contains all of my code developed with HStar Technologies and their cRoNA robot.  The second, robotic_repositioning, contains all of my code written under a NIDRR grant and published in a 2016 RO-MAN conference paper.
