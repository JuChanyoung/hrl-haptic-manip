This directory contains modules related to running an MPC on a robot.  Hopefully this will be generalizable to a variety of robots and to a variety of applications, but it will at least work for the simple lifting robots for lifting a human leg.

Modules include:
	- waypoint module
	- optimization module
	- model module
	- communication module
	- data logging module
	- user interface  module
