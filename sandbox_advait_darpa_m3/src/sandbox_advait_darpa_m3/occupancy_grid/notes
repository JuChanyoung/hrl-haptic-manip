Nov 21, 2011:

 - starting to try out octomap
 - downloaded octomap_mapping stack (tagged 0.3.5) and
   octomap_visualization stack (0.1.1)
 - also downloaded armnavigation stack (for arm_navigation_msgs):
     hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/armnavigation/armnavigation ./armnavigation
 - install libqt dependencies for octomap_visualization, look at rosdep.yaml


Steps for initial visualization:
 - get freiburg_outdoor.bt from http://octomap.sourceforge.net/
   (bottom of the page)

 - cd octomap_visualization/octovis/octovis/bin
 - run octovis and open freiburg_outdoor.bt

Steps for initial visualization in rviz:
 - rosrun  octomap_server octomap_server_node <path to freiburg.bt>
     * should see something like:
        [INFO] [1321902579.719058922]: Octomap file /home/advait/temp/freiburg_outdoor.bt loaded (5619516 nodes).
 
 - rosrun rviz rviz and open the file: darpa_m3/viz/octomap_viz_default.vcg
