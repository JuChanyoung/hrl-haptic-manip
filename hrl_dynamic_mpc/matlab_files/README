These are highly undocumented matlab files that I used to generate
results for the following:

-testing effects of modeled time duration of impact for impulse-momentum model
-varying of mass and control loop timing for robustness testing
-testing of model prediction over a horizon of 5 with and without contact
-comparing the quasi-static and dynamic controllers for Kreacher and a single link of Kreacher

The problem descriptions used to generate the CVXGEN solvers can be
found in the "cvxgen_problem_description" folder. It should only
require modifying the length of the horizon on these description files
to regenerate all of the data presented in my dissertation. However,
many of the file paths in my scripts were defined relative to the
Robotics Toolbox (from Peter Corke) which must also be installed for
any of this code to work. I am willing to provide some limited
support, but these files should be cleaned up a lot (including
sections of repeated code blocks) before it would be generally useful.
