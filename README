Trials for the quasi-static model predictive controller with a three
link simulated planar arm can be executed with the script at the
following location:

gt-ros-pkg.hrl-haptic-manip/sandbox_advait_darpa_m3/25_obstacle_configurations/bash_scripts/run_multiple_trials.sh


It should prompt for any needed inputs or you can check the file
manually. Many of the other files in this branch are likely
unnecessary to run these trials, but I haven't yet cleaned them up.
