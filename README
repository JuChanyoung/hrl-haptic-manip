Trials for the dynamic model predictive controller with a three
link simulated planar arm can be executed with the following script:

gt-ros-pkg.hrl-haptic-manip/sandbox_marc_darpa_m3/src/haptic_controllers/three_link_mpc_lin_dyn/run_multiple_trials.py

An example of its use can be found at:
gt-ros-pkg.hrl-haptic-manip/sandbox_marc_darpa_m3/src/haptic_controllers/three_link_mpc_lin_dyn/run_trials_colossus.sh



Unfortunately, the CVXGEN controller in this file was an intial
attempt to include damping for the contact model.  The description
file for the original controller used for our humanoids 2013 paper is
included however at the following location:

gt-ros-pkg.hrl-haptic-manip/sandbox_marc_darpa_m3/src/haptic_controllers/three_link_mpc_lin_dyn/humanoids_cvxgen_solver.description


Building this controller in CVXGEN and minor modifications to the file at:
gt-ros-pkg.hrl-haptic-manip/sandbox_marc_darpa_m3/src/haptic_controllers/three_link_mpc_lin_dyn/basic_test_mpc_with_dynamics.py

should allow someone to reproduce the results we obtained for that paper.
